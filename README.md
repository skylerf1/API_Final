All this code is heavily connected to Google Drive and Google Colab since DDSP is a google product. On this github you will find the two notebooks that are required to reproduce our results. Furthermore we have sent a folder with all required data and models which needs to be uploaded to Google Drive to you. This folder is also downloadable here from our google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wjGe80Elx1GbS1Pfa2m-6ya0yaI6W_s-?usp=sharing. 
The layout of the folder should be kept the same within Google Drive and the notebooks will guide you through adding the correct paths. Make sure to enable GPU within Google Colab.
